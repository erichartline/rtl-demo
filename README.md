# RTL Demo

This is a Next.js app to demonstrate common app scenarios and how they can be tested with `react-testing-library` and `msw`.

1. `HelloWorld` - basic component rendering
2. `TodoList` - user interactivity with input field, submit button and new data added to page
3. `CitiesList` - data fetching component that uses `msw` for displaying mock data
